### **Next Steps & Clarifying Questions**

* **Waitlist Promotion:** When a user is auto-promoted from the waitlist, should they have a "confirmation window" (e.g., 4 hours) to accept the spot, or is the promotion final?
* **Notifications:** Would you like me to draft a story for **Email/Push Notifications** regarding RSVP confirmations, waitlist moves, and when a suggested topic gets a manager?
* **Admin Dashboard:** Do you need a specific view for Admins to see a bird's-eye view of all RSVPs and Waitlists across multiple events?

**Would you like me to focus on the data model for the "Recipe" history or the "Notification" logic next?**
