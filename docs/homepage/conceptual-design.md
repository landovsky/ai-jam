# Conceptual framework
for how to present the AI Jam community on my website to achieve those goals.

### **1\. The Core Messaging (The "Manifesto")**

Your homepage introduction needs to disarm the visitor immediately. It should say: "We are not gurus; we are just figuring this out together."

**Draft Copy for the Homepage:**

**Stop Watching. Start Building.**

We believe the only way to understand AI is to get your hands dirty. The **AI Jam** is a fortnightly meetup in Prague for people ready to switch from passive reading to active experimenting.

* **No Experts:** We are all learning. There is no stage, only tables.
* **No Sales:** We are here to solve personal and professional problems, not buy software.
* **No Judgment:** A failed experiment is just as valuable as a successful one.

### **2\. The "Recipe Gallery" (Showcasing Past Work)**

To make the content "easily digestible," avoid long blog posts. Structure your website’s main feed as a **Gallery of Cards**.

Visual Concept:
Imagine a Pinterest-style grid. Each card represents a previously solved problem.
**The Card Layout (Public View):**

* **Title:** "Automating Weekly Meal Prep"
* **Tags:** \#Personal \#ChatGPT \#Notion
* **The Hook:** "Saved 2 hours/week."
* **The 'Click to Reveal':** When clicked, it expands to show the **Recipe**:
  1. **The Goal:** What we tried to achieve.
  2. **The Prompt:** *\[Copy button\]* The exact text used.
  3. **The Result:** A screenshot or link.
  4. **The Learner:** "Built by \[Name\] at AI Jam \#4."

This structure serves the **Networking** goal: If I see that "Petr" is good at automating Excel with Python, I want to meet Petr at the next Jam.

### **3\. The "Ticket" System (Invite for a Recipe)**

This is your unique mechanism. Instead of "Buying a Ticket," you "Contribute a Finding."

How to frame this to lower Imposter Syndrome:
You must emphasize that a "Recipe" doesn't have to be complex code. It can be a simple prompt that worked well for writing an email.
**The "Request Invite" Page Logic:**

**Want to join the next Jam?**

Our sessions are hands-on and space is limited. To keep the quality of peer-learning high, the price of admission is **one experiment**.

**Don't panic.** You don't need to be a coder.

* *Did you find a prompt that writes great birthday wishes?* Share it.
* *Did you try to use AI to summarize a PDF and it failed?* Share the failure\!

\[ Form Field: What is your Recipe? \]
(Describe the problem, the tool, and what happened)
**\[ Button: Submit & Request Invite \]**

**Why this works:**

1. **Filters for Doers:** It discourages people who just want to sit back and consume.
2. **Icebreaker:** When a new person arrives, you already know what they are working on ("Hey, you're the guy who tried to automate his gardening, right?").
3. **Content Engine:** These submissions become the content for your website's Recipe Gallery.

### **4\. The Site Architecture (Simple)**

* **Home:** The "Manifesto" \+ The latest 3-6 Recipe Cards.
* **The Cookbook (Archive):** Filterable list of all past topics (Work, Life, Image Gen, Text).
* **Join Us:** The "Exchange" form described above.

### **5\. Managing the "Imposter Syndrome"**

To specifically target this, I suggest adding a **"Failure of the Month"** badge or category on your site.

If you publicly celebrate a time when AI hallucinated wildly or someone couldn't get a tool to work, it signals to new people: *"It is okay to not know what I'm doing."*

### **Summary of the Flow**

1. **Public:** Sees a cool "Recipe" on your site (e.g., via LinkedIn/Substack link).
2. **Interest:** Wants to learn how to do that or meet the person who did.
3. **Action:** Clicks "Join."
4. **Gate:** Is asked to submit their own small experiment (Success or Failure).
5. **Reward:** Gets an invite to the location (e.g., V Tůních) and joins the network.

**Would you like me to draft the specific questions for the "Request Invite" form to ensure you get high-quality (but accessible) submissions?**
